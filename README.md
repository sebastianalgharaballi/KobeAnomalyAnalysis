# KobeAnomalyAnalysis

This is a project where I developed a machine learning autoencoder to take a deep dive into Kobe Bryant's performance during the 2008-2009 NBA season. In summary, I imported, concatenated, cleaned, and normalized Kobe's game data in preparation for model training. 
I then created a fully functional autoencoder model using sequential layers, ReLU/Sigmoid activation functions, Adam optimization, and MSE loss.
I was able to successfully train the model to achieve a minimized regular and reconstruction loss, and analyzed performances using distribution of errors, elbow method, and encoded/decoded representations.
In totality, my model achieved 100% evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and was fully capable in labeling Bryantâ€™s above or below average games. Uploaded is my research report where I described the in's and out's of the project in even more detail.
